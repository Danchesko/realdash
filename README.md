# Real-time dashboard

We live in a world of data: terabytes, petabytes and even exabytes of data surround us. Sometimes companies cannot use this big and messy data to draw conclusions from, that's when information dashboards come into play. 
Dashboard is a visual representation that gives a quick and easy way to view performance of something particular in real-time.

This dashboard works as a template, for demonstration - System Information such as CPU load and Memory load were artificially generated, but you can change it to whatever you want.
